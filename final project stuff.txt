final project stuff

Note: Django will choose type of HTML form fields to use, based on types of model fields.
    example: when form has a model.TextField, Django will use a <textarea> (multi-line text input box).
    Often, this is OK. For this assignment it is fine.
    you can customize how HTML form displays, tell Django type of form 
    field to use.
    For example, you can add these form fields as data attributes in form CreateProfileForm :
    class CreateProfileForm(forms.ModelForm):
        first_name = forms.CharField(label="First Name", required=True)
        birth_date = forms.DateField(widget=forms.SelectDateWidget(years=range(2012,1920,-1),),)
See details in Django Forms Documentation page.
